This directoy focuses on the C variables if else and while. The following show what each task does.
* 0-positive_or_negative.c - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
  * The output of the program should be:
    * The number, followed by
      * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
      * if the number is 0: is zero
      * if the number is less than 0: is negative
    * followed by a new line
* 1-last_digit.c - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
  * The output of the program should be:
    * The string Last digit of, followed by
    * n, followed by
    * the string is, followed by
      * if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
      * if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
      * if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
    * followed by a new line
* 2-print_alphabet.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* 3-print_alphabets.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
* 4-print_alphabt.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  * Print all the letters except q and e
* 5-print_numbers.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* 6-print_numberz.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line without using variable char.
* 7-print_tebahpla.c -  prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
* 8-print_base16.c - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* 9-print_comb.c - prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
