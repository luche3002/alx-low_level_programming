This part of the low-level programming project focuses on debugging and below is what every task of the project does:
* 0-main.c - test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
* 1-main.c - Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
* 2-largest_number.c - Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
* 3-print_remaining_days.c - Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
