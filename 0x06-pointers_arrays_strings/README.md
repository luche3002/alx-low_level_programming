* 0-strcat.c - concatenates two strings.
* 1-strncat.c - concatenates two strings.
  * it will use at most n bytes from src; and
  * src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
* 2-strncpy.c - copies a string.
* 3-strcmp.c -compares two strings.
* 4-rev_array.c - reverses the content of an array of integers.
* 5-string_toupper.c - changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
