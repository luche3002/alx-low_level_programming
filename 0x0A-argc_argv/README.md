This part of the project focuses on the us of argc and argv in c programming:
* 0-whatsmyname.c - a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
  * If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
  * You should not remove the path before the name of the program
* 1-args.c -  prints the number of arguments passed into it.
  * prints a number, followed by a new line
* 2-args.c - prints all arguments it receives.
* 3-mul.c - multiplies two numbers.
* 4-add.c - adds positive numbers.
